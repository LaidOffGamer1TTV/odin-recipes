    </ul>

    <or>
        <li>Slice the stem ends of the bok choy off to separate the 
            leaves. Wash and drain the leaves; discard the ends. Cut the leafy green part of the leaves from the white part, keeping both parts separated.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or wok over high heat; add oil. 
            Cook and stir ginger in the hot oil for 1 minute. Add shrimp and continue cooking until they are bright pink and opaque, reducing heat as necessary 
            to prevent burning, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir white pieces of bok choy, broccoli, 
            zucchini, soy sauce, vermouth, brown sugar, and rice vinegar into the skillet. Cover and continue cooking until bok choy begins to soften, 4 to 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir to coat the vegetables with the liquid. Sprinkle with cornstarch and stir until it mixes in and disappears. Top with the green pieces of bok 
            choy, cover, and continue cooking until leaves start to wilt and the sauce thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir to coat everything with sauce. Serve hot.</li>
